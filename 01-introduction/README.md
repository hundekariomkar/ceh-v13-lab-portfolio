# 01 – Introduction to Ethical Hacking 🔐

## 📌 Lab Overview

This module establishes foundational concepts required for ethical hacking and structured penetration testing as practiced during CEH v13 labs.

The lab activities focused on understanding the ethical framework, attack lifecycle, and security risk components before performing technical assessments.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand ethical hacking principles  
- Identify different types of threat actors  
- Analyze core security fundamentals (CIA Triad)  
- Study the CEH attack lifecycle methodology

## 🛡 Ethical Hacking Fundamentals

Ethical hacking involves authorized security testing performed to identify vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them.

Key principles applied:

- ✔ Proper authorization  
- ✔ Defined scope of engagement  
- ✔ Controlled testing environment  
- ✔ Responsible disclosure  
- ✔ Professional documentation

## 👥 Types of Threat Actors

- 🟢 White Hat – Authorized security professional  
- 🔴 Black Hat – Malicious attacker  
- 🟡 Gray Hat – Operates without formal permission  
- 🧰 Script Kiddie – Uses pre-built tools  
- 🌍 Nation-State Actor – Government-sponsored attacker

## 🔒 Core Security Concepts

### 🔺 CIA Triad

- **Confidentiality** – Protecting sensitive information  
- **Integrity** – Ensuring data accuracy and trustworthiness  
- **Availability** – Maintaining reliable system access  

All security assessments ultimately evaluate weaknesses affecting one or more of these principles.

## 🔁 CEH Attack Lifecycle

1. Reconnaissance  
2. Scanning  
3. Enumeration  
4. Gaining Access  
5. Maintaining Access  
6. Clearing Tracks  

This structured methodology forms the foundation for all subsequent technical lab modules.
