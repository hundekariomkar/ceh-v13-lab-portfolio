# CEH-v13-lab-Reports
🔐 Structured CEHv13 lab portfolio demonstrating reconnaissance, vulnerability assessment, exploitation, web security testing, and defensive mitigation strategies.

# CEH v13 Lab Reports 🔐

This repository documents hands-on cybersecurity labs completed during preparation for the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH v13) certification.

The content is structured module-wise and rewritten in my own words to reflect practical execution, methodology, findings, and mitigation strategies.

⚠️ Disclaimer: This repository does not contain proprietary EC-Council material. All documentation represents personal lab work and learning outcomes.
